## Introduction

**Morning Recovery** is an innovative alarm app designed to motivate users to wake up by challenging them to solve quizzes in order to silence the alarm. Traditional alarm clocks often make it too easy to hit the snooze button and go back to sleep. Our app offers a refreshing approach to waking up effectively and feeling rejuvenated. It is ideal for students, busy professionals, and anyone looking to improve their morning routine.

### Key Features

1. **Task-Based Alarms:** Instead of simply hitting snooze, users must complete a task to turn off the alarm, such as solving math problems or puzzles. This ensures a more effective wake-up experience.

2. **Customizable Challenges:** Users can choose from a variety of customizable math problems and challenges.

3. **Daily Famous Quote:** After successfully solving the math problems, users are rewarded with a famous daily quote for inspiration.

### Your Competition

Some similar apps in the market include "Math Alarm Clock" and "Puzzle Alarm Clock." While these apps are effective, our app distinguishes itself with a user-friendly and visually appealing design, customizable challenges, and the daily famous quote feature, providing a more engaging and refreshing wake-up experience.

### Main Modules of Your App

**Mobile Device Side:**

- **Alarm Interface:** Manages the alarm functionality, including setting, managing, and triggering alarms.
- **Activity Selection:** Allows users to choose the type of activity(and level of activity) they need to perform to disable the alarm (e.g., solving a puzzle, or solving quiz).

**Server-Side:**

- **Activity Database:** Stores various activities that users can choose from to disable alarms.

**Third-Party Software or Services:**

- **Push Notification Service:** Used to send real-time alarms and notifications to users' devices.

### Innovation

The most innovative aspect of our app is its reliance on mobile device sensors and features, such as the accelerometer, to provide a unique and immersive user experience.

### Testing Devices

For testing, we are developing the app using Android Studio and will be conducting tests on Android Virtual Devices (AVD). All team members can access AVD through Android Studio, which will allow us to ensure the app's compatibility across different Android devices and versions.
